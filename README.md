# Todo List
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

This project is structured in an attempt to recreate a MVC architecture. It loosely follows [Tania Rascia's tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/) on the subject.
